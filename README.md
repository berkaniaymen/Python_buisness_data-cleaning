# Python_buisness_data-cleaning

Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python
In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to help make key business decisions.

Project Scenario

In this project, you will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

Project Objectives

Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights

Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance

Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

Challenge

the challenge is is  to conduct an exploratory data analysis to help make key business decisions. To do this, you will load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using the dataset provided.

In this project, we'll use a data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings.
